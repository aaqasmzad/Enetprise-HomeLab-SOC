## 🎯 Project Overview

This HomeLab replicates the infrastructure of a small-to-medium enterprise, encompassing:

- **Centralized Identity Management** via Active Directory with GPO-enforced policies
- **Role-Based Access Control** with department-level file share segmentation
- **Real-time Threat Detection** using a self-hosted Wazuh SIEM with custom detection rules
- **Automated Incident Response** that autonomously isolates attackers without human intervention
- **Network Perimeter Defense** with IDS/IPS and Layer 3/7 web filtering
- **Network Segmentation** via VLAN-isolated trust zones with inter-VLAN firewall enforcement and custom IPS rules targeting lateral movement

The lab is intentionally *adversarial* — every defensive control was validated by actively simulating the attack it was designed to stop.

## 🚀 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1 — Core Infrastructure & Identity Management

**Objective:** Establish a functional corporate domain with automated user management. 

- Deployed Windows Server 2022 as the primary Domain Controller for `hlab.lan`
- Disabled OPNsense DHCP to consolidate IP management under the DC
- Wrote a **PowerShell provisioning script** to bulk-import users from CSV into appropriate Organizational Units (OUs)
- Enrolled Windows 10 workstations to the domain for centralized policy management

> 💡 *Why it matters:* Manual user creation doesn't scale. Automated provisioning reduces human error and ensures consistent OU/group membership from day one.

![AD User Provisioning](images/ad-ous.png)![](images/ad-user-script.png)

---

### Phase 2 — Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & File Services

**Objective:** Enforce least-privilege access to sensitive departmental data.

- Deployed **Windows Server Core** (`FS-CORE`) to minimize the attack surface — no GUI, no unnecessary services
- Remotely managed via the DC's Server Manager over the network
- Created `IT_Data` and `HR_Data` SMB shares with NTFS permissions tied to AD Security Groups (`SG_IT_Dept`, `SG_HR_Dept`)
- Configured **GPO with Item-Level Targeting** to auto-mount the correct drive letter (`I:` or `H:`) based on the authenticated user's group membership

> 💡 *Why it matters:* RBAC prevents lateral movement — a compromised HR account cannot access IT files, limiting blast radius.

![Mapped Drives](images/gpo-drive-maps.png)![](images/gpo-item-level-targeting.png)

---

### Phase 3 — SIEM Deployment & Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

**Objective:** Gain visibility into endpoint activity and block data exfiltration vectors.

- Deployed **Wazuh All-in-One** on Ubuntu Server; enrolled Windows endpoints via PowerShell agent scripts
- Blocked USB mass storage devices via GPO (`Access Denied` on removable media)
- Modified Wazuh agent config to ingest `DriverFrameworks-UserMode` Windows event logs
- Authored **Custom Rule ID 110001** in `local_rules.xml` to trigger a **High-Severity SOC alert** on every USB insertion event — even when blocked by policy

> 💡 *Why it matters:* Blocking without logging is blind enforcement. This combination ensures policy violations are both *prevented* and *recorded* for audit trails.

![USB Block & Alert](images/wazuh-usb-log-2.png)![](images/wazuh-usb-log-3.png)![](images/wazuh-usb-log-4.png)

---

### Phase 4 — File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) & Insider Threat Detection

**Objective:** Detect unauthorized file operations on sensitive network shares in real-time.

- Configured Wazuh FIM agent on `FS-CORE` to actively monitor `IT_Data` and `HR_Data` directories
- Simulated insider threat scenarios: unauthorized file creation, modification, and deletion
- SIEM displayed precise **timestamps, affected file paths, and the responsible user account** for each event

> 💡 *Why it matters:* Insider threats are notoriously hard to detect. FIM creates a forensic audit trail that can prove *who* changed *what* and *when*.

![File Integrity Monitoring](images/fs-fim-ossec-conf.png)![](images/wazuh-fim-alert.png)

---

### Phase 5 — Active Directory Security & Privilege Escalation Detection

**Objective:** Harden AD against brute force and unauthorized privilege escalation.

- Enforced **Account Lockout Policy** via GPO: account locks after 5 failed attempts
- Simulated an RDP brute force attack — account locked and **Wazuh fired alert on Event ID 4740**
- Simulated an insider threat: standard user added to `Domain Admins` group — immediately flagged as a **Critical alert** by Wazuh

> 💡 *Why it matters:* Privilege escalation is Stage 4 of most kill chains. Detecting it in seconds versus days is the difference between an incident and a breach.

![Account Lockout Alert](images/wazuh-priv-escalation-1.png)![](images/wazuh-priv-escalation-2.png)


---

### Phase 6 — Automated Incident Response (Active Response)

**Objective:** Move from passive detection to autonomous threat containment.

- Configured Wazuh **Active Response** triggered by repeated authentication failures (Rules 60122 / 60204)
- Upon threshold breach, SIEM executed a `firewall-drop` script on the target endpoint **without human intervention**
- The script dynamically created a **Windows Defender Firewall block rule**, isolating the attacker's source IP

> 💡 *Why it matters:* Mean time to respond (MTTR) drops from minutes to milliseconds. Attackers executing automated brute force are stopped before credentials are cracked.

![Active Response Firewall Drop](images/wazuh-ar-rule.png)![](images/wazuh-ar-rule-level-1.png)![](images/wazuh-ar-rdp-fail.png)![](images/wazuh-ar-rule-level-2.png)

---

### Phase 7 — Defense Evasion Detection (MITRE ATT&CK: T1070.001)

**Objective:** Detect adversaries attempting to destroy forensic evidence.

- Elevated specific event rules to **Critical (Level 12)** by overriding defaults in `local_rules.xml`
- Simulated a post-compromise attacker clearing the Windows Security Audit Log to cover tracks
- Wazuh detected Windows Event ID 1102 via Custom Rule 110002 and triggered the Critical alert

> 💡 *Why it matters:* Clearing logs is a standard attacker technique to hinder forensics. Detecting the clearing event itself turns the attacker's evasion attempt into additional evidence.

![Defense Evasion Detection](images/wazuh-evasion-rule.png)![](images/wazuh-evasion-alert.png)

---

### Phase 8 — Network Perimeter Security (OPNsense)

**Objective:** Enforce corporate web policy and block network-level threats.

- Created **Firewall Aliases** grouping social media domains; implemented L3/L4 drop rules on outbound LAN traffic

![OPNsense Webfilter Alias/Rule/Result](images/opnsense-webfilter-alias.png)![](images/opnsense-webfilter-rule.png)![](images/opnsense-webfilter-done.png)

- Enabled **Suricata IPS** in promiscuous mode on LAN/WAN interfaces
- Downloaded **Emerging Threats (ET) Open** rulesets
- Validated IPS effectiveness by simulating a malicious payload request (`curl testmyids.com`) — Suricata converted the alert to a **drop action at Layer 7**

> 💡 *Why it matters:* A firewall without IPS only enforces policy on known-bad IPs/ports. Suricata inspects payload content, catching threats that bypass traditional port-based rules.

![Suricata IPS Drop](images/opnsense-ips-enable.png)![](images/opnsense-ips-alert.png)![](images/opnsense-ips-drop-1.png)![](images/opnsense-ips-drop-2.png)

---

### Phase 11 — Network & Infrastructure Maturity

**Objective:** Segment the flat network into isolated trust zones and harden IPS with lateral-movement-aware detection rules.

- Designed a **four-zone VLAN architecture**: MGMT (VLAN10 — `10.10.10.0/24`), SERVER (VLAN20 — `10.10.20.0/24`), CLIENT (VLAN30 — `10.10.30.0/24`), and ATTACKER (VLAN40 — `10.10.40.0/24`) — all trunked over a single physical LAN link to the KVM host
- Configured VLAN sub-interfaces in OPNsense (`Interfaces → Other Types → VLAN`) with the existing LAN port as the trunk parent; existing `10.10.10.0/24` subnet retained as MGMT to avoid re-provisioning DC, Wazuh, and OPNsense

![VLAN Creation in OPNsense](images/opnsense-vlan-add-1.png)![](images/opnsense-vlan-add-2.png)![](images/opnsense-vlan-add-3.png)

- Preserved **Windows Server DC as the sole DHCP authority** — configured OPNsense DHCP Relay (instead of DHCP Server) to forward requests from VLAN20/30/40 to `10.10.10.10`; created matching scopes on the DC
- Enforced **inter-VLAN firewall policy** with default-deny between all zones; created a `DC_Required_Ports` alias (DNS/53, Kerberos/88, NTP/123, RPC/135, LDAP/389, SMB/445, GC/3268, RPC-dynamic/49152-49200) and applied targeted pass rules for domain-joined VLANs to reach the DC — all other inter-VLAN traffic blocked

![DC Required Ports Alias & DHCP Scopes](images/dc-required-ports.png)![](images/vlan-dhcp-scopes.png)![](images/vlan-rules-block-pass.png)

- Built **VLAN-tagged bridges** on the Arch Linux KVM host (`br-server`, `br-client`, `br-attacker`) bound to VLAN sub-interfaces of `br0`; attached VMs to their respective bridges via `virt-manager`
- Authored a **custom Suricata ruleset** (`crules.rules`) targeting lateral movement: SMB enumeration (threshold-based), ADMIN$ share access, PsExec service creation (`PSEXESVC`), and cross-VLAN attacker traffic from VLAN40 — hosted via Python HTTP server on Wazuh and pulled into OPNsense via `custom.xml`

![Suricata Custom Rules & Policy](images/suricata-custom-rules.png)![](images/suricata-custom-rules-xml.png)![](images/suricata-custom-rules-enabled.png)

- Configured an **IDS Policy** (`HLAB-Drop-Lateral-Movement`) to override all four custom rule actions from `alert` to `drop` inline — converting passive detection to active blocking

![](images/suricata-custom-rules-sid.png)![](images/suricata-custom-rules-policy.png)

> 💡 *Why it matters:* A flat network means a single compromised endpoint can reach every other host. VLAN segmentation enforces blast-radius containment at the network layer, while custom Suricata rules ensure that lateral movement techniques — the core of most post-compromise kill chains — are detected and dropped before they succeed.
